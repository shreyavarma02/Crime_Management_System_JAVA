Synopsis:
In this project, we are aiming to create a crime management system. This platform can be used by 4 sets of users- the civilians, the police personnel(Police officers and Police incharges) and head officers. The civilian can register themselves on this site, lodge a complaint as well as see their complaint history along with the status of each crime reported by them. The police personnel further consist of police officers and the incharge officers. There is one police station in a given location and every police station has 1 incharge and multiple police officers. Once a complaint is lodged by a civilian, the incharge views it(only if it has been registered in that particular police station) and assigns it to one of his/her police officers based on their specializations (murder, robbery, kidnapping etc.). The police incharge is also responsible for creating a ranking list to award the top 3 police officers. Once a case has been assigned to a police officer, he/she can view it and make the required updates to the case. The police incharge can view all these updates. The head officer is incharge of managing the police incharges’ records and the police incharge is responsible for managing the police officers’ records. The head officer can also view inference of crime rates based on the location of the crime committed. Overall, our project aims to create a centralized method of maintaining crime records.
